SIGN-TEXT USING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS

GOAL:CREATE 2 DEEP LEARNING MODELS 1 USING CNN WHICH CONVERTS ALPABET SYMBOLS IN American Sign Language(ASL) to TEXT,& ANOTHER MODEL-RNN WHICH CONVERTS JESTURES SUCH AS HELLO,GOODMORNING,SORRY,THANKYOU TO TEXT
We have created our own dataset as a proper dataset was not available for the project,also the Dataset available on the Kaggle was having different backgrounds and it will significantly drop the Model Performance.
